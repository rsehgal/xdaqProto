#How to use xdaqAppCreator
1. Within this directory run the bootStrap.sh script
   > sh bootStrap.sh

2. Above step will create a env.sh file in the same directory.

3. Now source the env.sh file
   > source env.sh

4. Run the main   xdaqAppCreator.sh script from any directory.
   with following arguements "ProjectName" and "PackageName"
   > sh xdaqAppCreator.sh TestProj TestApp

5. Step 4 will create a XDAQ project with Project Name as "TestProj" and Package Name as "TestApp"
   which you can compile. It will come with simple default functionality.

#Compiling the XDAQ project created using above steps

6. The project is created with a default Makefile which is sufficient enough to compile the default
   project. For compiling just do make
   > make

7. Thats all, your default project is compiled and ready to get loaded in hyperdaq

#Loading the project in the hyperdaq

8. The Default project is having a sample xml file in the xml folder which can
   be used to load the application in hyperdaq by using following
   > xdaq.sh -c xml/<packageName>.xml

9. If everything goes well, then the application will be loaded in hyperdaq and one
   can access it using web browser by visiting following URL:
   http://<you-web-server-name>:1972    
  


NOTE : 1972 is the default port that XDAQ is using, If required then, one can change this port
